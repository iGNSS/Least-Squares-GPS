# Least-Squares-GPS
MATLAB Solver that computes the kinematic position of a LEO satellite using Least Squares Estimation. This is a part of a greater filtering project.
KTH Orbit library functions are also used in this work. Feel free to use it as anyway you like!

Yo can choose the satellite that you intend to work with from the folders within this repository.
